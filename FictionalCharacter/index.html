    <p><em>the little mermaid</em></p>
    <p>ariel is the seventh daughter of king triton, the sea king. she is the best singer in the water since her mother athena passed away. </p>
    
    <p> with her spunky love of human stuff, she makes friends with scuttle, a seagull who thinks he knows everything.
    when she goes up to the surface, she spots prince eric and his dog, max, on a ship. </p>
    
    <p> she chases him and grows distant to her sisters and father, who worry about her and beg for her to come back.
    when ursula, the evil part-octopus, finds out that ariel is king triton's achilles heel, she makes her servant eels, flotsam and jetsam, spy on the red-headed princess.
    they trick her into trading her voice for a pair of human legs and ursula tells her that if she does not get prince eric to love her by the third sunset, ursula gets to keep her voice and her soul.
    secretly, ursula plans on keeping ariel's voice and soul both ways; she tells flotsam and jetsam to distract prince eric every time he gets close to falling in love. </p>

    <p> when everything seems to be going in ariel's favor, ursula transforms herself into a beautiful maiden and sings to prince eric using ariel's voice.
    it was ariel's voice in the first place that made him love her and when he finally heard who seemed to be that maiden, ursula cursed him and made him forget about ariel.
    in the end, ariel does not manage to gain the prince's love by the third sunset and ursula tells ariel that her soul and voice belong to ursula for eternity.
    at the last second, king triton steps in and says he will trade his own soul for ariel's freedom. ursula agrees. </p>

    <p> with the king of the sea gone, ursula takes his triton, crown, and throne and transforms into a giant beast.
    she summons a huge whirlwind to come swallow ariel and eric, but both "humans" survive and push ursula into her own whirlwind. </p>

    <p> every soul ursula had ever trapped were freed, including king triton, and ariel and prince eric got married.</p>
