    <em id="tag-line">"The perfect, golden child~" - as Mirabel sings in 'The Family Madrigal'</em>
    <p>Isabela is a major character and the sister of Mirabel Madrigal in the 2021 Disney film, Encanto.</p>
    <p>As Julieta's first child and an older sister to Luisa and Mirabel Madrigal, Isabela feels the need to be effortlessly beautiful in every way.
    Isabela is, by far, treated the worst by Abuela because of the pure fact that Abuela believes her power is to be "perfect"</p>
    <hr />
    <div class="sympathy">
        <p>Isabela has gone through a lot in her lifetime and is arguably more unfortunate than Mirabel has ever been.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>Abuela treated her like a perfect doll instead of a talented grandchild.</li>
            <li>Isabela was forced to marry a man she did not like (Mariano) - with no complaints or exceptions.</li>
            <li>Her younger relatives frowned upon her as if she could change the power she was given or the way Abuela treated her.</li>
            <li>Isabela was forced into the perfect "pink princess" mold, though she just wanted to be herself.</li>
            <li>She had a cold relationship with Mirabel, who always ruined her opportunities and yet, still blamed her for everything.</li>
            <li>The whole entire Columbian society, her family included, pressured Isabela into that perfect mold that she was always trying to fit in.</li>
            <li>Isabela failed to express her emotions no matter how much she yearned to.</li>
            <li>She could not do the same things other Columbian teenagers and children could do because those things were not what perfect children should do.</li>
            <li>Even after trying so hard to please her family, Abuela was never satisfied and pushed her until she no longer knew who she was anymore.</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="sympathy">However, as the story progresses, it is revealed that Isabela's power is to simply make beauty, which comes in many shapes and colors.
    Her first experience of making something beautiful that was not exactly perfect was the Mickey Mouse-shaped cactus that appears in her duet with Mirabel, 'What Else Can I Do?'.</p>

    <div class="picture">
        <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Isabela_Madrigal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            <img class="isabela-img" src="https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1969993/encanto-hidden-mickey.webp?w=600&q=75&f=39c42c71005ae521c2c02396a010ba6b" alt="isabela's mickey cactus" width="400px" height="200 px"></a>
    </div>

    <p> The making of that cactus makes her realize her true potential and who she was truly born to be: herself.
        In 'What Else Can I Do?', Isabela shows her true capability to create beauty and not just perfect pictures.</p>
    <em>"What could I do if I just grew what I was feeling in the moment?</em>
    <em>What could I do if I just knew it didn't need to be perfect?" - as Isabela sings in 'What Else Can I Do?'</em>
    <p>In this duet with her youngest sister, Isabela finally steps out of the cave her family has squeezed her in.
        She finally learns the true meaning of beautiful - not perfect, but genuine.
        She realizes what she has long yearned to realize: that beauty can come in many shapes, colors, and sizes.
        She realizes that she herself is perfect no matter who she wants to be and what types of plants she wants to create - whether spiky or soft, colorful or muted.</p>
    <p>Isabela appears in Bruno's vision twice, once in 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' and once in 'What Else Can I Do?'</p>
    
    <em>"He told me that the life of my dreams
        would be promised, and someday be mine.
        He told me that my power would grow
        like the grapes that thrive on the vine." - as Isabela sings in 'We Don't Talk About Bruno"</em>
    
    <p>According to Bruno, Isabela will someday live the life she has always wanted to live (aka be true to herself) and she will accomplish her dreams (to prove to her family that beauty is not the same as perfection).</p>

    <em>"The way is clearer 'cause you're here, and well - I owe this all to you!" - as Isabela sings in 'What Else Can I Do' before hugging Mirabel.</em>
    <p> In the second vision, Isabela hugs Mirabel and causes Abuela's magic candle to burst in full power and heal all of the magic house's cracks.
        This vision also comes true.</p>

        </div>

    <p>Although Isabela is not introduced as a "perfect sister" for Mirabel, she truly does develop into one.</p>
    <em>"“Selfish?! I've been stuck being perfect my whole entire life! And, literally, the only thing you have ever done for me is MESS THINGS UP!”</em>
    <p>―Isabela Madrigal</p>
